# VelociView

Generate clean, customizable image overlays of your activity stats from GPX or TCX files. Drop in a photo and an activity file, tweak the appearance, and export a polished image ready to share.

**ðŸ’¡ Tip:** We recommend using **GPX files** for best results â€” they provide more complete elevation data, better GPS accuracy, and wider compatibility across fitness platforms.
